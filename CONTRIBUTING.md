Things to remember before commiting 
-> Have both conceptual and understanding of implementation of whatever code you will be commiting (if you don't know then simplest thing is go ahead , read on whatever the topic is , understand implementation) . Whatever you are commiting , you can document about that approach , it's usage , pros,cons. All of this will be checked only approvals goes ahead .

-> Try to follow good coding practices

Steps for the feature implementation: 
-> Create a documentation file for whatever feature/approach that you are mentioning . 
-> Create a route and then create a super short application over that route to demonstrate functionality of that feature (super important). 
-> If you have some specific folder structure , you can mention that in documentation file. 

and Add your name , along with the feature name in this file <br/>
Example <br/>
 [
    {
    name :"hack",
    feature : "showcased redux implementation"
    },{
    name:"Rajagopal",
    feature: "Demonstrate userequest hook"
    }
 ]
